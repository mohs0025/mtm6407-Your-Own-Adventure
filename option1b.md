# Sneak inside the shed and find a hiding place

You slip inside the shed, thinking it’s a safe spot to hide. The air smells musty, and in the darkness, you can make out a few old crates and tools. Just as you settle into a corner, you accidentally bump into something hard. Suddenly, a loud beeping sound fills the room. Your heart races as you realize it’s a bomb—there’s no time to react.

It was a bad decision. The bomb explodes, and everything goes dark.
