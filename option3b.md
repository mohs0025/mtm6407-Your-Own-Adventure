## Option: Climb the steep hill for a vantage point

You decide to scale the steep hill, your legs burning with every step as you push through the incline. The sounds of the guards chasing behind you fade as you climb higher. Once at the top, you take a moment to catch your breath and scan your surroundings. Below, you see the guards splitting up—some heading towards the forest, others searching the perimeter.

From your vantage point, you spot an old service road running along the far side of the hill. However, you quickly realize that the road is well-patrolled, with bright lights illuminating the area. It’s too risky to take it. The hilltop is also too exposed to stay hidden for long.

With no other viable options, you decide to retreat back down the hill. Now you’re faced with the same decision as before: take the narrow trail deeper into the woods or try the steep hill again for a better plan.
