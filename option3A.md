## Option: Take the narrow forest trail

You choose the narrow trail, your heart pounding as you dart deeper into the forest. The trees close in around you, providing cover, but the thick undergrowth slows your pace. Behind you, the shouts of the guards fade, though you know they’re still searching. As you push forward, you spot a small creek up ahead that could help mask your tracks, but it’s risky—you could lose your footing or worse, get stuck.

You decide to take the risk and cross the creek. As you step into the rushing water, the slippery rocks beneath your feet give way. You lose your balance, and before you can react, the fast-moving current pulls you under. You try to fight the water, but it's too strong. Within moments, you're swept downstream, your vision blurring as the cold water drags you under.

This is the end of your journey.
